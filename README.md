# ðŸ’Œ About Me:
Hey! I'm Louisa but I often viperidae! I'm a teen web-dev and upcoming game dev.<br>
I work mostly in Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and I'm currently learning C++ .<br>
Outside coding, I like playing video games. My faves are Stardew Valley, OverWatch2 and Forza Horizon 5.<br>
I'd love to hear your feedback on some of my work and projects, so feel free to contact me :)
