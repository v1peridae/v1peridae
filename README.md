# ðŸ’Œ About Me:
Hii! I'm Louisa but I often go by viperidae online (coz I'm just that cool)! I'm a teen web-dev and upcoming game dev (Epic Games should be watching out for me).<br>
I work mostly in Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and I'm currently learning C++ .<br>
When I'm not trying to figure out which line is missing a semi-colon or a closing bracket, I like gardening, playing video games and thinking alot about New York (embarassing but I just love New York). My faves are Stardew Valley, Overwatch 2 and Forza Horizon 5.<br>
I'd love to hear your feedback on some of my work and projects, so feel free to contact me :)
